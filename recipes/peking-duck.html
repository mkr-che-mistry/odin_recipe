  <h2 class="topic">Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>Five-spice powder: 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Sugar: 2 tablespoons</li    >
    <li>Salt: 1 tablespoon</li>
    <li>Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry): 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Maltose syrup: ¼ cup (or honey diluted with water)</li>
    <li>Scallions: 6, thinly sliced (green parts for garnish)</li>

  </ul>
  <h2 class="topic">Instructions (**Note:** This recipe requires a two-day process)</h2>
  <h3>Day 1: Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Thoroughly rinse the duck cavity and pat it dry with paper towels. Prick the skin all over with a fork or skewer, focusing on areas with thicker fat.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine five-spice powder, sugar, salt, and Shaoxing wine. Rub this mixture all over the duck skin, making sure to get it under the wings and legs. Massage the remaining mixture into the cavity.</li>
    <li>Inflate the duck skin (optional, but helps separate skin from meat): With a bicycle pump or similar tool (use a clean tip!), carefully insert the nozzle between the skin and flesh of the duck's neck. Inflate gently until the skin is puffed up but not taut. Be careful not to tear the skin.</li>
    <li>Let the duck air-dry in the refrigerator, uncovered, on a wire rack set over a baking sheet (to catch any drips) for 24 hours. This drying process helps crisp the skin.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Day 2: Cooking and Serving</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
    <li>Submerge the duck in the boiling water for 3-4 minutes. Remove and pat dry.</li>
    <li>Brush the duck skin with maltose syrup (or honey mixture). Hang the duck (using butcher's twine or similar) in a well-ventilated area for another 30-60 minutes to allow the skin to dry further.</li>
    <li>Roast the duck breast-side up on a wire rack set over a baking sheet for 45-60 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Baste the duck occasionally with the remaining maltose syrup during roasting.</li>
    <li>Reduce oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue roasting for another 30-45 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the thigh reaches 165°F (74°C).</li>
    <li>Let the duck rest for at least 20 minutes before carving. Slice the duck meat thinly and serve with pancakes, scallions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce for dipping.</li>
  </ol>
