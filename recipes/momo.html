  <img src="../images/momo.jpeg" alt="Momo">
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All-purpose flour: 2 cups</li>
    <li>Water: about ¾ cup (adjust for dough consistency)</li>
    <li>Ground meat (chicken, lamb, or pork): ½ pound</li>
    <li>Chopped onion: 1 small</li>
    <li>Grated ginger: 1 tablespoon</li>
    <li>Chopped garlic: 1 clove</li>
    <li>Chopped cilantro: ¼ cup</li>
    <li>Chopped green chilies (optional): to taste</li>
    <li>Salt: to taste</li>
    <li>Oil: for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and gradually add water, kneading until a smooth and elastic dough forms. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the dough rests, prepare the filling. In another bowl, combine ground meat, onion, ginger, garlic, cilantro, chilies (if using), and salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin sheet. Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles.</li>
    <li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Pinch the edges together to form crescent-shaped momos, making sure to seal them properly.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Carefully place the momos in the pan and cook for a few minutes until golden brown on the bottom. Add a splash of water to the pan, cover it, and steam the momos for 5-7 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
    <li>Serve momos hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as chili sauce or chutney.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Enjoy these delicious momos - a taste of the Himalayas!</p>
