  <ul>
    <li>All-purpose flour: 1 ½ cups</li>
    <li>Active dry yeast: 1 teaspoon</li>
    <li>Warm water: ¾ cup (adjust for dough consistency)</li>
    <li>Olive oil: 1 tablespoon</li>
    <li>Salt: 1 teaspoon</li>
    <li>Pizza sauce: ½ cup (your favorite brand or homemade)</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese: ½ cup, shredded</li>
    <li>Pizza toppings (of your choice): pepperoni, sausage, vegetables, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="topic">Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is foamy and activated.</li>
    <li>Add olive oil and salt to the yeast mixture. Gradually stir in flour until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
    <pre>**Preheat your oven to its highest temperature setting (ideally 475°F or higher) and preheat a baking sheet or pizza stone along with the oven for at least 15 minutes.**</pre>
    <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to your preheated baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
    <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edge. Top with your favorite pizza toppings and shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade creation!</li>
